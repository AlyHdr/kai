1771250162-1,Zombie peppers,"These petrifying peppers, stuffed with blood-red veggie rice, make a real monster of a meal!Prep: 10 mins
Cook: 50 mins
Serves 4",,"Slice the tops off the peppers and put the lids aside. Remove and throw away the seeds. With a sharp knife, carefully carve a spooky face into each pepper. Once they're scary enough, put the peppers in a roasting tray and turn on the oven to preheat to 180C (fan 160C, gas mark 4).
  
    
  Information: 
  If they're old enough, the kids can carve the faces into the peppers themselves. Just make sure to keep an eye on them at all times. Younger ones can tell you what face to carve, or draw what they would like instead!


  

          
            


  
    Bring a pan of water to the boil and cook the rice according to the packet instructions. When it's ready, drain and set aside.
  

          
            


  
    While the rice is cooking, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium-high heat and fry the onions until softened and beginning to go see-through – about 5 minutes.
  

          
            


  
    Take the pan off the heat, then add in the cooked rice, grated beetroot, grated cheese, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper and herbs. Mix well.
  
    
  Information: 
  Stuffed peppers are a great way to use up leftovers all year round, so skip the carving (if you want!) and experiment. Chilli, veg-loaded cous-cous, and pasta in tomato sauce all work brilliantly, for example.


  

          
            


  
    Spoon the filling into the peppers, and put their lids back on. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until they've softened but are still holding their scary shape! Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then dish up with a side of salad and enjoy.

Put the fish fillets in a bowl, then pour in the mixture. Turn and brush the fish well to make sure it's completely covered by the marinade. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or even overnight).
  

          
            


  
    To make the sauce, heat the oil in a large pan and add the onions and peppers. Cook for about 5 minutes on medium heat until they have started to soften and turn golden. Then add the remaining 2 sprigs of thyme and the scotch bonnet (if using), and cook for 1 more minute. Add the marinated fish, tomatoes and salt, gently stir and spoon the sauce over the fish. Turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
    
  Information: 
  Next time, mix things up by swapping the fish for skinless chicken or lean goat meat.


  

          
            


  
    While the fish is cooking, make the cou cou. Add the cornmeal to a mixing bowl and slowly add just enough cold water to cover it. Use a wooden spoon to mix to a smooth paste, with no dry lumps visible. Set this cornmeal paste aside.
  

          
            


  
    Put the diced okra in a pot with about 400ml of water. Bring to a medium boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes until the okra softens. Use a sieve or colander to drain the okra, making sure to keep the hot okra water. Put the okra aside, then pour about a quarter of the hot okra water back into the pan and the rest into a jug.
  

          
            


  
    With the heat on low, gradually add a quarter of the soaked cornmeal mixture to the okra water in the pot, and whisk to a smooth paste. Add the oil to the mixture and whisk well, before gradually adding the rest of the okra water and cornmeal. Whisk continuously until all the cornmeal and liquid is well mixed and smooth.
  

          
            


  
    Switch to a wooden spoon and keep mixing the cornmeal for another 2 or 3 minutes. It will start to bubble and thicken, so will need mixing harder to avoid lumps. At this point add the cooked okra and mix for another few minutes, or until the okra is well incorporated though the cornmeal, and then remove from the heat.
  
    
  Information: 
  For softer cou cou, add more boiled water at this stage. You can also try adding more vegetables for a different texture – diced red and yellow peppers work well.
